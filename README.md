Usage
Add your stock dataset named orcl.csv to the project directory.
Run main.py to calculate SMA and RSI values.
Find the results in the generated orcl-sma.csv and orcl-rsi.csv files.


Details of SMA and RSI Calculation
SMA (Simple Moving Average)
SMA is an indicator that helps us analyze trends by taking the average of closing prices over a specific period.

RSI (Relative Strength Index)
RSI is an indicator that helps us evaluate the overbought or oversold condition of a price by comparing gains and losses of an asset.
